# About This Project
This project is a result of this [blog post from Auth0.](https://auth0.com/blog/developing-restful-apis-with-python-and-flask/) I started with the code from the tutorial there and then kept on developing my own endpoints and methods to practice building out more functionality for this API. 

# About Me
I am having fun learning more and more Python all the time.

# Future Plans
- implement transaction IDs
- handle errors gracefully
- refactor
